<p>TotalEnergies had signed an investment agreement known as the Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP) with the Iraqi government under Prime Minister Mustafa Al Kadhimi in 2021. This project aimed to reduce gas flaring and improve gas development operations. However, subsequent governments have faced criticism for rebranding these initiatives as their own.
